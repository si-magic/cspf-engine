# CPPPolicyd-spf
TODO

[SPF Engine](https://launchpad.net/spf-engine) rewrite in C++ language for more
efficiency.

Postfix+Dovecot can become a better combo if the SPF implementation is also in
compiled static language just like the rest.

## Requirements
- Drop-in replacement for pypolicyd-spf
  - Conflicts with `(py|perl)policyd-spf`
